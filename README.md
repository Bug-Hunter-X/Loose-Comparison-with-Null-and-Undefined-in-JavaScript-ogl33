# Loose Comparison with Null and Undefined in JavaScript

This repository demonstrates a common JavaScript bug related to loose comparison (==) with null and undefined values.  The loose comparison operator does not distinguish between null and undefined, leading to unexpected behavior.

The `bug.js` file shows the problematic code, while `bugSolution.js` provides the corrected version using strict equality (===).
